<p>&quot;Morning of the Hanging&quot; was produced by a workshop
funded by The<br/>
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,
under the direction of<br/>
Mark Headley. Michael Fleming was a
workshop participant with writing<br/>
&amp; directing
responsibilities. Other participants took on the<br/>
cinematography,
editing, music, casting, and acting roles.<br/>
<br/>
Headleyand
Fleming make a movie together every 50 years, so they are<br/>
about
due for a new production!</p>

<p>The eight minute western was filmed on Saturday, April 1, 1978 at
Old<br/>
Tucson movie set and amusement park with a 16mm spring wound
Bolex. We<br/>
had costumes from Old Tucson wardrobe that we got for
the cleaning<br/>
fees, and we had free run of all the exterior sets.
We had to pay $20<br/>
for the horse.<br/>

<p>&quot;The New Maverick&quot; TV movie was using the courthouse set
at Old<br/>
Tucson. Maverick was my favorite TV show when I was 10
years old in<br/>
1957. From the theme song: &quot;Ridin' the trails
to who knows where,<br/>
luck is his companion, gambling is his game&quot;
Sounds good to me!<br/>
<br/>
The crew were behind the security lines
for the production, so we had<br/>
full access to the set, and all
that activity. I didn't visit, but it<br/>
was nice to be around the
arc lights and all the camera sand equipment<br/>
for a Hollywood
production.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One
of the crew took the opportunity to ask James Garner if he would<br/>
come
for a cameo in our movie.<br/>
<br/>
During his lunch break, he came
over to our set wearing the<br/>
distinctive Maverick costume, with a
striped vest and his cowboy hat<br/>
with a distinctive brim. I
explained that he was to refuse the<br/>
Sheriff's request, and walk
down the wooden sidewalk. We had one<br/>
rehearsal. He looked at me,
&quot;Was that OK?'&quot; I said it was.<br/>
<br/>
The take with the
spring wound camera motor running was even better,<br/>
with
exaggerated gestures and facial expressions that suited the
bit<br/>
perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
Reportedly, he received $1m for a one
minute tv commercial pitching<br/>
Kodak, so his bit was probably
worth a couple hundred thousand 1978<br/>
dollars.</p>
<p><br/>
The crowd visiting Old Tucson were thrilled to see a real
Hollywood<br/>
movie star. I remember the clicks of the shutters on
the instamatic<br/>
cameras of the crowd. Our crew were in a lot of
vacation photographs!<br/>
<br/>
The narration and music recording
was done in a sound studio in the<br/>
same session. Mark got
together a few musicians who wrote original<br/>
music and also
improvised as the film was shown in the sound studio.<br/>
<br/>
A
cowboy poet narrated the story. He added an authentic voice to
the<br/>
story. He also improvised the best lines in the film.<br/>
<br/>
Many
talents go into film making, and the cast and crew
exceeded<br/>
expectations in all areas.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Lee Garmes was the advisor on the film. He worked with
the<br/>
cinematographer on the crowd scene, placing props and extras
so as to<br/>
make the crowd seem bigger than it really was. He was
generous in<br/>
sharing his knowledge and experience over a decades
long career as<br/>
cinematographer on top Hollywood movies,
including &ldquo;Gone with the Wind&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and Shanghai Express with Marlene Dietrich.</p>
<p><br/>
Some other stories:<br/>
<br/>
One of the workshop
participants told me this:<br/>
<br/>
Someone from the New Maverick
production told James Garner that the<br/>
Old Tucson amusement park
was using his name in their radio ads.<br/>
<br/>
Garner looked
shocked. &quot;My name! They're using my name! I've had<br/>
enough.
I'm outa here!&quot; The crew was aghast. One of the stars of
the<br/>
movie had just walked out endangering the schedule and every
thing<br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
A beat later, Garner stuck his head in
the door of the courtroom.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;April fools!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The
scene when the stranger loses his hat was unintentional. We<br/>
brought
the horse back and set up the scene again. This time the
horse<br/>
wouldn't gallop, and no amount of bouncing up and down in
the saddle<br/>
would persuade the horse to hurry anywhere soon. It
was sort of<br/>
comical.<br/>
<br/>
This shot was getting expensive
in terms of time on the set and film<br/>
stock. The horse was not
galloping any more that day, so we had to<br/>
select the blown off
hat take for the movie. It was sort of painful<br/>
since hats are
not optional for a horseman on the Arizona desert<br/>
<br/>
The
workshop films were presented at Gallagher theater on the<br/>
University
of Arizona campus. Lee Garmes was in attendance and praised<br/>
the
crew's performance under great time pressures.<br/>
<br/>
In 1980,
KUAT-TV, the PBS affiliate in Tucson, put on a program about<br/>
film
makers of Tucson and chose Morning of the Hanging for one of
the<br/>
short films. I was interviewed as part of the show.<br/>
<br/>
The
next public showing was at the screening room in downtown
Tucson,<br/>
with Mike and Mark in attendance.<br/>
